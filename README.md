In this project, I was able to practice all that I leanrned in the Intermediate Course of HTML and CSS. This course includes topics below

-Grid
-Grid & Flex
-SVGs
-Tables
-CSS Units
-Frameworks and Preprocessors
-Browser compatibitlity
-Positioning
-Form Basics
-Form Basic Validation

All these still needs constant practice but I'll be there, one step at a time.

Hoping to graduate in tutorial hell!!!!
